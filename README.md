# WordPress Social Share Widget

A lightweight social share widget.

This plugin is currently under development. It was initially designed for the Vega theme as a sidebar widget, but is now being slowly modified for use with all themes and is to include it's own css stylesheet.

To use the widget download and place in wp-content/plugins. The widget can then be activated from the admin plugins screen.
